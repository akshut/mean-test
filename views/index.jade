          | Security in health care is of utmost importance. As such, Doxy.me provides a secure, HIPAA-compliant communication tunnel between the doctor and the patient which uses 128-bit /*is this right?*/ AES encryption and [anything else?]. Furthermore, data is never recorded or made accessible to others. You can rest assured that the doctor and patient are the only ones who know what is going on during the Doxy.me call.
